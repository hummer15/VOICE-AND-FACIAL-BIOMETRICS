# Voice and Facial Recognition System

The Voice and Facial Recognition System is a comprehensive biometric authentication solution that combines facial and voice recognition technologies. It provides functionalities for adding and deleting users' vocal and facial data, along with seamless integration with existing security systems.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Recognizes users based on facial features captured by the system's camera.
- **Voice Recognition**: Identifies users by analyzing their vocal patterns and characteristics.
- **User Management**: Allows administrators to add, delete, and manage users' vocal and facial data.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing security systems to enhance access control and authentication processes.
- **Security**: Utilizes advanced biometric technology to ensure high levels of security and accuracy.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and deploy the Voice and Facial Recognition System.

### Prerequisites

- [Insert any prerequisites here, e.g., hardware requirements, software dependencies]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/voice-facial-recognition.git


 Today's Pandemic has made us realise that apart from the facial recognition we also need a touch-less system which can help in identification of a person. This double identification technique will improve our existing system. Thus we aim to develop a system where we use the techniques of facial and voice biometrics to recognise(or identify) a person.
