# VOICE_AND_FACIAL_BIOMETRICS-_PROJECT
 Today's Pandemic has made us realise that apart from the facial recognition we also need a touch-less system which can help in identification of a person. This double identification technique will improve our existing system. Thus we aim to develop a system where we use the techniques of facial and voice biometrics to recognise(or identify) a person.
